Hi, i  hereby presenting my web integreted face detection and face recognition model.
Model is completely made in python using open source libraries like opencv,numpy,dlib
opencv is open source computer vision library and dlib provides pretrained model that helps in face detection and face recognition.
i have used two models from dlib
  shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
  dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat
face landmark model identify different points on face.
for integration with web i provided user an interface that is coded in html,css,javascript
for backend i used django framework written in python.
views.py contains the model and url.py handels different url requests.
